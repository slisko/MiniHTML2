      <p>
        A loading coil or load coil is an inductor that is inserted into an
        electronic circuit to increase its inductance. The term originated in
        the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in
        long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for
        inductors in radio antennas, or between the antenna and its feedline, to
        make an electrically short antenna resonant at its operating frequency.
        The concept of loading coils was discovered by Oliver Heaviside in
        studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first transatlantic
        telegraph cable in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was
        required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the
        transmitted signal. The mathematical condition for distortion-free
        transmission is known as the Heaviside condition. Previous telegraph
        lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need
        for extra inductance was not as great. Submarine communications cables
        are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century
        installations using balanced pairs were often continuously loaded with
        iron wire or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which
        avoided the sealing problem. Loading coils are historically also known
        as Pupin coils after Mihajlo Pupin, especially when used for the
        Heaviside condition and the process of inserting them is sometimes
        called pupinization.

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <h3>Telephone lines</h3>
      <p>
        A common application of loading coils is to improve the voice-frequency
        amplitude response characteristics of the twisted balanced pairs in a
        telephone cable. Because twisted pair is a balanced format, half the
        loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the
        balance. It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same
        core. This increases the flux linkages, without which the number of
        turns on the coil would need to be increased. Despite the use of common
        cores, such loading coils do not comprise transformers, as they do not
        provide coupling to other circuits. Loading coils inserted periodically
        in series with a pair of wires reduce the attenuation at the higher
        voice frequencies up to the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter
        formed by the inductance of the coils (plus the distributed inductance
        of the wires) and the distributed capacitance between the wires. Above
        the cutoff frequency, attenuation increases rapidly. The shorter the
        distance between the coils, the higher the cut-off frequency. The cutoff
        effect is an artifact of using lumped inductors. With loading methods
        using continuous distributed inductance there is no cutoff. Without
        loading coils, the line response is dominated by the resistance and
        capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with
        frequency. With loading coils of exactly the right inductance, neither
        capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, waveforms are
        undistorted and the characteristic impedance is resistive up to the
        cutoff frequency. The coincidental formation of an audio frequency
        filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.
      </p>
      <h4>DSL</h4>
      <p>
        With loading coils, signal attenuation of a circuit remains low for
        signals within the passband of the transmission line but increases
        rapidly for frequencies above the audio cutoff frequency. If the
        telephone line is subsequently reused to support applications that
        require higher frequencies, such as in analog or digital carrier systems
        or digital subscriber line (DSL), loading coils must be removed or
        replaced. Using coils with parallel capacitors forms a filter with the
        topology of an m-derived filter and a band of frequencies above the
        cut-off is also passed. Without removal, for subscribers at an extended
        distance, e.g., over 4 miles (6.4 km) from the central office, DSL
        cannot be supported.
      </p>
      <h4>Carrier systems</h4>
      <p>
        American early and middle 20th century telephone cables had load coils
        at intervals of a mile (1.61 km), usually in coil cases holding many.
        The coils had to be removed to pass higher frequencies, but the coil
        cases provided convenient places for repeaters of digital T-carrier
        systems, which could then transmit a 1.5 Mbit/s signal that distance.
        Due to narrower streets and higher cost of copper, European cables had
        thinner wires and used closer spacing. Intervals of a kilometer allowed
        European systems to carry 2 Mbit/s.

      <h3>Radio antenna</h3>
      <p>
        Another type of loading coil is used in radio antennas. Monopole and
        dipole radio antennas are designed to act as resonators for radio waves;
        the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the
        antenna's transmission line, excites standing waves of voltage and
        current in the antenna element. To be “naturally” resonant, the antenna
        must have a physical length of one quarter of the wavelength of the
        radio waves used (or a multiple of that length, with odd multiples
        usually preferred). At resonance the antenna acts electrically as a pure
        resistance, absorbing all the power applied to it from the transmitter.
        In many cases for practical reasons it is necessary to make the antenna
        shorter than the resonant length, this is called an electrically short
        antenna. An antenna shorter than a quarter wavelength presents
        capacitive reactance to the transmission line. Some of the applied power
        is reflected back into the transmission line and travels back toward the
        transmitter. The two currents at the same frequency running in opposite
        directions causes standing waves on the transmission line, measured as a
        standing wave ratio (SWR) greater than one. The elevated currents waste
        energy by heating the wire, and can even overheat the transmitter. To
        make an electrically short antenna resonant, a loading coil is inserted
        in series with the antenna. The coil is built to have an inductive
        reactance equal and opposite to the capacitive reactance of the short
        antenna, so the combination of reactances cancels. When so loaded the
        antenna presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing
        energy from being reflected. The loading coil is often placed at the
        base of the antenna, between it and the transmission line (base
        loading), but for more efficient radiation, it is sometimes inserted in
        the center of the antenna element itself (center loading). Loading coils
        for powerful transmitters can have challenging design requirements,
        especially at low frequencies. The radiation resistance of short
        antennas can be very low, as low a few ohms in the LF or VLF bands,
        where antennas are commonly short and inductive loading is most needed.
        Because resistance in the coil winding is comparable to, or exceeds the
        radiation resistance, loading coils for extremely electrically short
        antennas must have extremely low AC resistance at the operating
        frequency. To reduce skin effect losses the coil is often made of tubing
        or Litz wire, with single layer windings, with turns spaced apart to
        reduce proximity effect resistance. They must often handle high
        voltages. To reduce power lost in dielectric losses, the coil is often
        suspended in air supported on thin ceramic strips. The capacitively
        loaded antennas used at low frequencies have extremely narrow
        bandwidths, and therefore if the frequency is changed the loading coil
        must be adjustable to tune the antenna to resonance with the new
        transmitter frequency. Variometers are often used.

      <h3>Bulk power transimission</h3>
      <p>
        To reduce losses due to high capacitance on long-distance bulk power
        transmission lines, inductance can be introduced to the circuit with a
        flexible AC transmission system (FACTS), a static VAR compensator, or a
        static synchronous series compensator. Series compensation can be
        thought of as an inductor connected to the circuit in series if it is
        supplying inductance to the circuit.
