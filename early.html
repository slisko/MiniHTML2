      <h1>Early Life and Education</h1>
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Mihajlo Pupin</b> was born on 4 October (22 September, OS) 1858 in
        the village of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idvor">Idvor</a> (in the
        modern-day municipality of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kova%C4%8Dica">Kovačica</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</a>) in the region
        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banat">Banat</a>, in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Frontier"
          >Military Frontier</a
        >
        of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire"
          >Austrian Empire</a
        >. He always remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his
        autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):
      </p>
      <p>
        "My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so
        much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with
        another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much
        wonderful knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get
        unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which
        we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path
        through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory."
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox
        school, and later to German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in
        high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of
        the best students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential
        and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.
        Because of his activity in the "Serbian Youth" movement, which at that
        time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin
        had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the
        sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in March
        1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in
        Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States. When
        I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents
        in my pocket. Had I brought five hundred dollars, instead of five cents,
        my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would
        have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin
        his career until he has spent all the money which he has brought with
        him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of
        prune pie, which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained
        nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it
        would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus
        things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in
        each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless;
        it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for
        an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the
        hardships that may be in store for him.
