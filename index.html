          <b>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin</b>, Ph.D., LL.D. 9 October 1858 â€“ 12 March
          1935), also known as Michael I. Pupin was a Serbian American
          physicist, physical chemist, philanthropist and patriot. Pupin is best
          known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending
          the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading
          coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire
          (known as "pupinization"). Pupin was a founding member of National
          Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on 3 March 1915, which later
          became NASA.[5] In 1924, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his
          autobiography. Pupin was elected president or vice-president of the
          highest scientific and technical institutions, such as the American
          Institute of Electrical Engineers, the New York Academy of Sciences,
          the Radio Institute of America, and the American Association for the
          Advancement of Science. He was also a honorary consul of Serbia in the
          United States from 1912 to 1920 and played a role in determining the
          borders of newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
